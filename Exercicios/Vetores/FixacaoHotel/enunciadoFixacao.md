###Fixation Exercise###

The owner of a guesthouse has ten rooms available for rent to students, with these rooms being identified by numbers from 0 to 9.

Write a program that starts with all ten rooms empty, and then reads an integer N representing the number of students who will rent rooms (N can be from 1 to 10). Then, register the rental information for each of the N students. For each rental, provide the student's name, email, and the room number they chose (from 0 to 9). You may assume that only vacant rooms are chosen.

At the end, the program should print a report of all occupied rooms in order of room number.
