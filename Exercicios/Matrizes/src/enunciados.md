# Two-Dimensional Array (2D Array) Exercises

1. **Neighbors of a Number in a Matrix**
   - Read two integers **M** and **N**, then read an MxN matrix of integers (which may contain repeated values).
   - Then read an integer **X** that is guaranteed to exist in the matrix.
   - For each occurrence of X, print its **left**, **up**, **right**, and **down** neighbors, if they exist.

2. **Main Diagonal and Count of Negative Numbers**
   - Read an integer **N** and then an NxN square matrix of integers.
   - Display:
     - The **main diagonal**
     - The **number of negative values** in the matrix.

3. **Matrix Element Filtering (5x5)**
   - Read the elements of a **5x5** matrix from the user.
   - Then:
     - a) Print the entire matrix.
     - b) Print the elements where the **row index is even** and the **column index is odd**.
