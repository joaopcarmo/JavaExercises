### üîÅ Loop and Repetition Structure Exercises

1. **Odd Numbers from 1 to X**  
   - Read an integer **X** (1 ‚â§ X ‚â§ 1000).  
   - Display all **odd numbers from 1 to X**, one per line (including X if it is odd).

2. **Interval Check: In and Out**  
   - Read an integer **N**, the number of values to be tested.  
   - Then read **N integers**, and display how many of them are **"in"** the interval [10, 20] and how many are **"out"**.

3. **Weighted Average Calculation**  
   - Read an integer **N**, representing the number of test cases.  
   - For each test case, read 3 decimal values.  
   - Calculate and display the **weighted average**, with weights: 2, 3, and 5 respectively.

4. **Division with Zero Check**  
   - Read an integer **N** (number of pairs).  
   - For each pair, perform division of the first by the second.  
   - If the denominator is zero, print `"division impossible"`.

5. **Squares and Cubes from 1 to N**  
   - Read an integer **N**.  
   - Print **N lines**. Each line should contain:
     - The line number (starting from 1)
     - Its **square**
     - Its **cube**

6. **Password Validation Loop**  
   - Repeatedly read an integer (password) until it is equal to **2002**.  
   - For incorrect values, display `"Invalid Password"`.  
   - When correct, display `"Access Granted"` and end the program.

7. **Fuel Preference Counter**  
   - Read fuel types entered by clients:
     - `1` = Alcohol  
     - `2` = Gasoline  
     - `3` = Diesel  
     - `4` = End  
   - For invalid codes (not 1‚Äì4), ask again.
   - When code `4` is entered, show `"THANK YOU"` and display the **count of each fuel type** chosen by clients.
