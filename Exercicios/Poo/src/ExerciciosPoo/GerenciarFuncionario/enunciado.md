### 👨‍💼 Employee Net Salary and Raise Calculation

**Problem Statement**

Write a program to read the data of an employee, including:

- Name  
- Gross salary  
- Tax (amount to be subtracted)

The program should then:

1. Display the employee’s **name and net salary** (gross salary minus tax)
2. Read a percentage to **increase the gross salary**
3. Apply the increase, and display the **updated name and net salary**

Create a class `Employee` to encapsulate the operations and logic. Only the **gross salary** should be affected by the percentage. The **net salary** should be calculated dynamically.

> 💡 Use object-oriented principles like encapsulation and computed properties.

**Example:**

Name: João Silva
Gross salary: 6000.00
Tax: 1000.00

Employee: João Silva, $5000.00

Which percentage to increase salary? 10.0

Updated data: João Silva, $5600.00
