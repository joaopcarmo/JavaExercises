### 📐 Rectangle: Area, Perimeter, and Diagonal Calculation

**Problem Statement**

Write a program that reads the **width** and **height** of a rectangle. Then, use a class to calculate and display the following:

- **Area**  
- **Perimeter**  
- **Diagonal**

Use object-oriented programming principles by creating a class (e.g., `Rectangle`) to encapsulate the data and methods for the calculations.

> 💡 Use the Pythagorean theorem to calculate the diagonal:  
> `diagonal = sqrt(width² + height²)`

**Example:**

Enter rectangle width and height:
3.00
4.00

AREA = 12.00
PERIMETER = 14.00
DIAGONAL = 5.00
