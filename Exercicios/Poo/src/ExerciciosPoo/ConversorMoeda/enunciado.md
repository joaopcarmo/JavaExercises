### ðŸ’± Currency Converter with IOF Tax

**Problem Statement**

Write a program that reads the **current dollar exchange rate** and then the **amount of dollars a person wants to buy**. The program should calculate and display how much the person must pay in **Brazilian reais**, considering a **6% IOF tax** over the dollar amount.

The calculation logic must be encapsulated in a dedicated **CurrencyConverter class**.

> ðŸ’¡ Use object-oriented programming by creating a class with a static method to handle the conversion.

**Example:**

What is the dollar price? 3.10
How many dollars will be bought? 200.00
Amount to be paid in reais = 657.20
