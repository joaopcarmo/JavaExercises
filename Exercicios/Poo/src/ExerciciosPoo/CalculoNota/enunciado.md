### ðŸŽ“ Student Grade Evaluation

**Problem Statement**

Write a program that reads a student's **name** and their **three grades** from the academic year:

- First trimester (weight = 30 points)
- Second trimester (weight = 35 points)
- Third trimester (weight = 35 points)

The program should then:

- Calculate the **final grade** of the student.
- Display **PASS** if the final grade is 60 or above.
- Otherwise, display **FAILED** and how many points were **missing** to reach 60.

Create a class named `Student` to encapsulate the logic and calculations.

> ðŸ’¡ The total possible score is 100. The passing grade is 60.

**Example:**

Enter student name: Alex Green
Enter the three grades:
27.00
31.00
32.00

FINAL GRADE = 90.00
PASS
