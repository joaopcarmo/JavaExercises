## 💼 Worker Contracts & Monthly Income Calculation

### 📝 Description (English)

Develop a program that reads data about a worker and their hourly contracts. The user must input the worker’s department, personal information, and multiple contracts (date, hourly rate, and duration). After that, the program asks for a specific month and year (MM/YYYY) and outputs the worker’s income for that period, considering their base salary and the total value of contracts within that month.

The application should model the following:

- A **Department** with a name.
- A **Worker** with a name, level (enum: `JUNIOR`, `MID_LEVEL`, `SENIOR`), base salary, and a list of hourly contracts.
- A **HourContract** that includes the contract date, value per hour, and duration in hours.

You must use object-oriented programming concepts such as:
- Association between classes
- Encapsulation
- Enumerations
